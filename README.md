# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project uses machine learning and data visualization to predict and analyze customer satisfaction based on support ticket data.

## 🔍 Project Summary

- Predict customer satisfaction (ratings from 1 to 5)
- Analyze support ticket trends (issue types, channels, priorities)
- Visualize insights using Power BI
- Use Random Forest for prediction

## 📁 Dataset

- Contains 8,469 customer support tickets
- Includes fields like:
  - Customer Age, Gender, Product
  - Ticket Type, Status, Priority
  - Response Time, Resolution Time
  - Satisfaction Rating

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run Python code**  
   Open `customer_satisfaction_model.ipynb` and run the cells to:
   - Clean the data
   - Train the model
   - View insights and feature importance

2. **View Dashboard**  
   Open `Customer_Satisfaction_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI to explore:
   - Ticket types
   - Satisfaction ratings
